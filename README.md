# Shortestpath
A solution to find the path of lowest cost (shortest path) when moving across a matrix.

Here it is a Material Design look-like application which exposes a low-cost algorithm to find the shortest path when moving across a matrix.

This algorithm is the one with the smallest Big O by making the job on a linear complexity: O(n)

Also, it implements TDD as part of the best practices of modern software development, such as:
- Java Unit testing: Based on JUnit library.
- Android Unit testing: Based on Robolectric library.
- Instrumented testing: Based on Espresso Library.

Just checkout the code, synchronize your project's gradle and enjoy!
